# Data Structures in C#

I love building data structures and I want to use this repo to track my learning journey.

List of data structures so far:

1. LinkedList  
   * Singly Linked List


2. Stacks  
   * Stacks built using arrays

## How to build
First you need to make sure you have .NET 7 installed. If you do not have it then [install .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

To build the library run these commands from the CLI in the `~/DataStructures/<folder-name>` directory of the chosen data structure:
```
dotnet build
```
To run tests from the CLI navigate to the `~/DataStructures/DataStructures.Tests` directory and run these commands:
```
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

From time to time I will visit this repo and add new data structure as I learn  

Feel free to walk through the project and do whatever you wish ðŸ˜‰
